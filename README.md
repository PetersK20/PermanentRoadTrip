This is the code for a Website that I created for my Aunt and Uncle

The Site Style Sheet provides the universal stylying for all of the pages and the Site Javascript provides the universalinteractions in all of the pages.
The website uses a PHP server with the server.php file that connects to a MySql database.
The css and js folders contain the js and css files for Jquery and Bootstraps.
The Img folder contains the images that the page needs in order to be rendered
The Image folder contains a set of images to show what the site looks like
The rest of the folders contain the files necessary for each individual page of the website.
